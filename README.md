# Cybersecurity Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my **Cybersecurity Internship at Pinnacle Labs**.  
The projects focus on understanding core cybersecurity concepts through simple Python implementations.

All projects are **educational and awareness-based** and do not represent real-world, production-grade security systems.

## Projects

- **Text Encryption System**  
  A menu-driven Python tool that demonstrates basic encryption and decryption logic for learning cryptography concepts.

- **Password Strength Analyzer**  
  A rule-based CLI utility that evaluates password strength and provides suggestions to improve password security.

- **Keystroke Logger**  
  A controlled project that demonstrates keystroke capture within a single active window, designed with ethical and educational intent.

## Disclaimer

These projects are intended strictly for educational purposes and should not be used in real-world environments.
